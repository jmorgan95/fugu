<h1>Slow cooked beef short ribs</h1>
<h2>Served with pancetta and mushrooms</h2>


<div class = recipe>
	
	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<p>Beef short ribs (5-6 bones)</p>
		<p>1 garlic bulb</p>
		<p>1 heaped tbsp tomato pur√©e</p>
		<p>250ml red wine</p>
		<p>250ml beef stock (chicken will work too)</p>
		<p>1 pack of bacon / pancetta lardons</p>
		<p>1 punnet of chestnut mushrooms</p>
		<p>Handful of parsley</p>
		<p>Olive oil</p>


	<h3>Method</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Prepare the beef by slicing alongside the bone, straight down, and season</li>
			<li>Place a roasting tray on the hob until nice and hot</li>
			<li>Heat the olive oil, then place the meat bone-side up. Sear</li>
			<li>Slice a whole garlic bulb in half, slide in to the roasting pan</li>
			<li>Stir in a heaped teaspoon of tomato puree and put it in the middle, cook it out. Add the red wine, bring to the boil, and reduce</li>
			<li>Add beef stock up until about an inch beneath the meat and bring to the boil</li>
			<li>Cover the roasting tray with tin foil so you braise from the bottom and steam from the top. Put in to the oven for 2.5 hours at about 170-180 degrees</li>
			<li>Just before you are due to take the short ribs out (5-10 minutes beforehand), prepare the lardons and slice the mushrooms. Fry the lardons until brown, then add the mushrooms</li>
			<li>To make the sauce, press the cooked garlic through a sieve into the cooking juices. Scrape the bottom of the sieve into the sauce. Sieve it all through to finish the sauce. Garnish the short ribs with parsley</li>	
		</ol>

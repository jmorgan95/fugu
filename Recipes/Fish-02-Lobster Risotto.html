<h1>Lobster Risotto</h1>
<h2>with tarragon and chives</h2>

<div class="ingredients">
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>800g lobster meat</li>
		<li>1.1l Shellfish stock</li>
		<li>3 shallots, finely diced</li>
		<li>400g of carnaroli risotto rice</li>
		<li>4 tomatoes, diced</li>
		<li>8 chives, cut into long batons</li>
		<li>20 small tarragon leaves</li>
		<li>3 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil</li>
		<li>95g of butter</li>
		<li>Cayenne pepper</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="method">
<h3>Method</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Gently heat the olive oil and 25g of the butter in a heavy-based pan. Once hot, add the shallots and sweat until soft but not coloured. Add the rice and fry lightly, stirring continuously until translucent. Season lightly with salt and cayenne pepper</li>
		<li>Add a ladleful of stock to the pan, stirring continuously until it has been completely absorbed by the rice. Repeat this process, one ladleful at a time, until all of the stock has been absorbed. Cook gently so the rice doesn't cook too quickly on the outside - this process should take 10-15 minutes</li>
		<li>Taste the risotto to check the seasoning and the texture of the rice - it should be soft with a slight bite. If you have used all of your stock and the rice is still too hard, add a splash of boiling water to finish</li>
		<li>Once cooked to your liking, add the remaining butter, diced lobster meat and diced tomatoes. Stir well, place a lid on the pan and leave to stand for 2 minutes. Divide the risotto into bowls and garnish with tarragon and chives</li>
	</ol>
